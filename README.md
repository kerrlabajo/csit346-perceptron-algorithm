# CSIT346 Perceptron Algorithm
## Vowel/Consonant Identifier

A console application in Visual Studio that predicts whether the letter is a vowel or a consonant letter with the use of Perceptron Algorithm.

For the meantime, this is only limiting to console app because of demanding computer performance requirement while also limiting to only 5 features instead of the 35 bit of each letters for a supposed pattern matching if the app were a windows form app using .NET Framework.
